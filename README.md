# Looping Lyrics

## Introduction
Many children songs repeat the same lines over and over again. It sure would save a lot of time to loop over the lyrics. 

## Objective

In this exercise, you will be demonstrating that you understand how to use loops effectively to repeat code and iterate over objects and arrays and how to use conditional statements by recreating the lyrics to children songs using as few statements as possible.
